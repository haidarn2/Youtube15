### FAQ
#### Q: What happens when the video title is too long?
*A: This applet supports text scrolling for video titles and uploader names that are too long.*

#### Q: How does this applet prioritize which YouTube tab to display?
*A: A video claims top priority if it was opened last & if it goes from a paused to play state.*

#### Q: What happens when I close an active tab/window?
*A: The applet will automatically switch to the last opened YouTube tab if available. If there are no YouTube videos open, the applet will display the following idle screen:*

#### Q: Help! the applet is not detecting YouTube videos anymore (or displaying them incorrectly)!
*A: YouTube periodically changes their page layouts so theres a possibility that the YouTube15-Helper needs updating, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/haidarn2/Youtube15/issues) if this happens. The YouTube15-Helper should be updated automatically through your browser when I push an update.*


#### Q: Cool! Can you make something similar for Spotify?
*A : Actually, this was based on the Spotify Applet; Spoti15, which I'm now maintaining [here](https://github.com/haidarn2/Spoti15).*
